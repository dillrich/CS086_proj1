# Introduction
In this project, you learn some basic object oriented design in Python.  Python is a powerful interpretive language which has both scripting and object oriented programing features.  This project is inspired by my recent TDY to Tokyo, Japan, where the vending machines which are more sophisticated and complex than the US vending machines.  In Japan, vending machines serve a spectrum of items -- beverages, food, toys, puppies, etc.  

You will create a program that acts as a super vending machine, even better than the ones in Japan.  You will provide a scriptable way to populate the machine, pay for items, dispense change, and record transactions.  

# Project Description

You are going to implement a text driven super vending machine.  The design will be up to you, but will be required to read commandline data:
| Command Syntax                            | Example                  | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------| 
| balance                             | balance                  | shows the balance                                           |    
| history                             | history                  | prints list of transactions                                 |
| inventory                           | inventory                | prints available items with name and ID                     |
| add item \<str\> \<int\> \<float\>  | add item chips 2 $1.00   | add an item name qty price                                  |
| buy item \<str\> \{5\}\<int\>       | buy item chips 1 2 2 4 3 | buys an item with \# dollars, quarters, dimes, nickles, <br> pennies. It also shows change given and the remaining <br> balance with currency distribution.  For change, the machine <br> uses the largest denominator of curenncy that is available.
| help                                | help                     | display help menu with these commands                       |
| exit                                | exit                     | exit the vending machine                                    |


## Sample Input

The sample input below is a sequence of correctly formatted commands. Your program should detect and ignore commands that are not correctly formatted.  

    add item chips 20 $.50  
    add item coke 5 $.75  
    add item diet coke 5 $.75
    inventory  
    buy item coke 0 3 0 0 0  
    inventory  
    buy item chips 1 0 0 0 0  
    buy item diet coke 0 2 0 0 0
    inventory  
    history  
    balance

## Strategy
For my development environment, I use [MS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on Windows with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and the Ubuntu LTS.  I rely on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html) in order to manage python libraries and set the python version.  There are many different ways to implement.  If you make an assumption, state it in the comments.  If you used a tutorial or found code online, add the reference location in the comments. Your program should provide basic error checking.  Review the [python 3.10 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.10/). This website on [regular expressions](https://pythex.org/) may also be helpful. 

## Submission Instructions
1. Create a github project that has the following:  
    1. readme with instructions on how to run the program and any dependencies, assumptions, etc.  
    2. sample input: the dataset you used for your program
    3. the source code
2. Submit the github https link in MS Teams so that I can pull down your repo by running:   

    git clone https...
